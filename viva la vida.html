<h2><strong>Coldplay</strong></h2>
<p><strong>I</strong> used to rule the world
    Seas would rise when <strong>I</strong> gave the word
    Now in the morning, <strong>I</strong> sleep alone
    Sweep the streets <strong>I</strong> used to own<p>

    <p><strong>I</strong> used to roll the dice
    Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
    Listen as the crowd would sing
    Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!<p>

    <p>One minute <strong>I</strong> held the key
    Next the walls were closed on me
    And <strong>I</strong> discovered that my castles stand
    Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand<p>

    <p><strong><strong>I</strong> hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
    Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
    Be my mirror, my sword and shield
    My missionaries in a foreign field
    For some reason <strong>I</strong> can't explain
    Once you go there was never, never an honest word
    And that was when <strong>I</strong> ruled the world</strong><p>

    <p>It was a wicked and wild wind
    Blew down the doors to let me in
    Shattered windows and the sound of drums
    People couldn't believe what I'd become<p>

    <p>Revolutionaries wait
    For my head on a silver plate
    Just a puppet on a lonely string
    Oh, who would ever want to be king?<p>

    <p><strong><strong>I</strong> hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
    Roman Calvary choirs are singing
    Be my mirror, my sword and shield
    My missionaries in a foreign field
    For some reason <strong>I</strong> can't explain
    <strong>I</strong> know Saint Peter won't call my name
    Never an honest word
    But that was when <strong>I</strong> ruled the world</strong><p>

    <p>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
    Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
    Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
    Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
    Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<p>

    <p><strong><strong>I</strong> hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
    Roman Calvary choirs are singing
    Be my mirror, my sword and shield
    My missionaries in a foreign field
    For some reason <strong>I</strong> can't explain
    <strong>I</strong> know Saint Peter won't call my name
    Never an honest word
    But that was when <strong>I</strong> ruled the world</strong><p>
